	  <p>Welcome to the Micello Maps Javascript Web API, a fully interactive, customizable HTML5
	  map control that displays Micello indoor maps.</p>
	  <p>To get started, all you need is a Micello Map API key which can be obtained
	  <a href="" onclick="alert('Keys are invitation only during the private beta period.');return false;">here</a>.
	  Once you have a key, the following links can help get you started:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li><a href="tutorial/showMapTutorial.html">Tutorial and Programming Guide</a> - Guide to getting started programming the API.</li>
		  <li><a href="classref/index.html">Class Reference</a> - JSDoc reference for the public classes in the API.</li>
		  <li><a href="structref/index.html">Non-class Reference</a> - This is the format of structures used in the code which are
			  not instantiated as classes. Rather they are constructed by adding properties to
		  a new object.</li>
