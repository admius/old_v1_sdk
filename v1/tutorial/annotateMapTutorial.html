	  <h1>Tutorial II: Putting Annotations on the Map</h1>

	  <p>There are three types of objects you can put on the map:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li> <b>Marker Overlay</b> - This is an object that is tacked to the map at a single
			  point. As the map zooms in and out, the object stays fixed in size. It is used
			  to mark objects.</li>
		  <li> <b>Geometry Overlay</b> - This is a piece of geometry added to the map. It has identical
			  properties to and behaves exactly like the items in the base map.</li>
		  <li> <b>Geometry Inlay</b> - An inlay modifies the properties of an existing object on the map.
			  Any property can be modified, either for an object in the base map or an object added
			  as a geometry overlay. To do this, you specify the ID of the geometry to modify and the
			  properties you want to change. The ID value of objects in the base map is a globally unique
			  positive integer. The ID of geometry overlay objects is assigned by the map control when
			  the object is added. It will be a negative integer that is unique for the given session.
			  Geometry inlays also go by the name or just "inlay".</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The following code demonstrates adding objects to the map. <a href="mapAnnotations.html" target="_blank">View Example Page</a></p>

	  <h3>Description of Example Page</h3>
	  <p>In the example two marker overlays are added. One, the red marker, is using a named marker looked up
	  from the theme of the map. The other, the clover, is created from a custom image.  There are
	  two geometry overlays added. One is a line from an entrance to Nordstrom. The other is a
	  polygon in the parking lot with the label "Tent Sale!". There is also an inlay added to the
	  map that changes the color of Macy's.</p>

	  <h1>Map Objects in Detail</h1>

	  <h2>Map Object Format</h2>
	  <p>The first thing to notice about the map objects is that they are not defined classes
		and they have cryptic variable names. This is because these objects are transferred over the
	  network and serialized directly from the response data stream. To create one of these objects
	  on the client side, instantiate a new object and attached the desired properties to it.</p>

	  <p>For more information on these objects see the portion of the API reference referred to as
	  the structure reference or the "non-class" reference.</p>

	  <h2>Common Properties among Map Objects</h2>
	  <p>The marker overlay, geometry overlay and inlay share a few common properties.</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li><b>zi</b> - "z index": This is used to give a drawing order for the object.
		  The exact interpretation depends on the type of overlay.
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>Marker overlays</b>: The z index gives the display order of the marker relative
			  to other markers. If no value is specified for a marker, the value of 1 is used.</li>
			  <li><b>Geometry overlays</b>: The zindex
		  gives the display order of the geometry overlay relative to other geometry overlays and the base
		  map geometry. The z index values in the range [0,1) are reserved for the base map. Any value
		  less than 0 will appear belows the base map. The value 1 or greater will appear above the
		  base map. If no value or a value in the range [0,1) is specified, a default value of 1 is
			  used for the geometry overlay z index.</li>
			  <li><b>Inlays</b>: The zindex specifies the order of drawing
		  relative to other inlays only. The inlays always appear on top of the base map or overlay on which
		  they are applied. If this value is not specified, it also defaults to the value 1.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li><b>anm</b> - "annotation name": This is used to group a set of annotations, including
		  marker overlays, geometry overlays and inlays. The name can be used to remove all the
		  annotations in a single remove call. Annotations can also be removed individually. The annotation
		  name parameter is optional.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Marker Overlay Properties</h2>
	  <p>The following list shows the properties that are specific to marker overlays.</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li><b>Location Parameters</b>: The location of a marker can be specified two ways. An explicit
			  x,y location and level can be specified or a geometry ID can be specified over which the
			  marker will be placed.
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>mx</b> - "map x": This is the X coordinate in map coordinates for the marker
				  ovelay.</li>
			  <li><b>my</b> - "map y": This is the Y coordinate in map coordinates for the marker
				  ovelay.</li>
			  <li><b>lid</b> - "level ID": This is the ID of the level on which the marker should be
				  placed.</li>
			  <li><b>id</b> - "geoemetry ID": If the object is placed over a goemetry rather than on an
				  explicit coordinate, this value is the ID of the geometry on which the object is placed.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li><b>Marker Specification</b>: The marker can be specified two ways. A named marker
			  can be used which is located in the theme file. (Reference for list of available markers is TBD).
			  Alternatively, a custom marker can be constructed using a specified image.
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>mt</b> - "marker type": This is the type of marker. The options are given in the enumeration
				  <a href ="../classref/symbols/micello.maps.shapetype.html">micello.maps.markertype</a>.
			  </li>
			  <li><b>mr</b> - "marker reference": This is the data that specifies the marker. The format
			  depends on the type of marker. The format can be referenced from the documentation on the
			  enumeration of marker types. </li>
		  </ul>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Geometry Overlay and Inlay Properties</h2>
	  <p>Geometry overlays and inlays share all the properties of geometry since a geometry overlay
	  is a geometry object and inlays are modifications to a geometry object. The only parameter that
	  has a different meaning for these is the id parameter. For the base map, the id is a globally
	  unique positive integer. For overlay goemetry the id parameter should not be defined by the user.
	  It will be assigned by the map control when the overlay is added. This can then be read from the
	  overlay and used to reference the overlay. It will be a negative integer that is unique for the session.
	  For an inlay, the id parameter is used to specify the geometry that should be modified, where it
	  can take on values for the base geometry or one of the geometry overlays.</p>

	  <h3>Geometry Overlay Specific Properties</h3>
	  <ul>
		  <li><b>id</b> - "id": This parameter should not be assigned by the user. This parameter is
		  assigned by the map control and can be used as a reference to specify the geometry overlay. It
		  will be a negative integer unique for the session.</li>
		  <li><b>lid</b> - "level ID": This is the ID of the level on which the geometry overlay should
			  be placed.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Inlay Specific Properties</h3>
	  <ul>
		  <li><b>id</b> - "id": This is the geometry Id of the geometry on which the inlay should act.
		  It can be a value in the base map or of a geometry overlay.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Geometry Rendering Properties</h3>
	  <p>The following list gives the geometry properties that are relevent for rendering. Additional
	  properties such as for interactions are shown elsewhere.</p>

	  <ul>
		  <li><b>id</b> - "id": This is a globally unique id used to identify the geometry.</li>
		  <li><b>Coordinates</b>: These properties relate to the shape of the object.
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>st</b> - "shape type": This tells the type of shape. The currently supported types
			  can be found in the enumeration
			  <a href ="../classref/symbols/micello.maps.shapetype.html">micello.maps.shapetype</a>.
			  </li>
			  <li><b>shp</b> - "shape": These are the actual coordinates for the geometry. The format of this
			  object depends on the type of shape. The format can be referenced from the documentation on the
			  enumeration of shape types.</li>
			  <li><b>gt</b> - "geometry type": Geometry type tells how the shape is rendered to make the
			  object. The enumeration of shape types can be found at
			  <a href ="../classref/symbols/micello.maps.shapetype.html">micello.maps.shapetype</a>.</li>
			  <li><b>gw</b> - "geometry width": This is the required width parameter for an object with
				  the geometry type linear area.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li><b>Style</b>: These properties relate to the rendering style of the object. See the definition
		  of the style structure at
		  <a href ="../structref/symbols/micello.maps.shapetype.html">micello.mapstruct.style</a>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>t</b> - "type": This is a named style that is taken from the theme file to render
				  the object. The name derives from the fact that the type of object dictates the style.
			  </li>
			  <li><b>os</b> - "override style": This is an explicity style object that will override the
				  named style to be used for the object.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li><b>Label</b>: These properties relate to the label for the object.
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>lt</b> - "label type": This is the type of label to put on the object. The label
				  types cn be found in the enumeration
				  <a href ="../classref/symbols/micello.maps.labeltype.html">micello.maps.labeltype</a>.
			  </li>
			  <li><b>lr</b> - "label reference": This is the label data. The format of the data depends
			  on the label type and is documented in the label type enumeration.</li>
			  <li><b>lr</b> - "label": This is the coordinates for the label. The format is documented in the
			  reference for the
			  <a href ="../classref/symbols/micello.mapstruct.geometry.html">micello.mapstruct.geometry structure</a>
			  </li>
			  <li><b>el</b> - "external label": This flag indicates the label sits ourside the area of the
			  shape and should be set to true if the label is outside the shape. If the label is inside
			  the shape the parameter can be left undefined.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
