	  <h1>Tutorial I: Placing a Map on a Page</h1>
	  <p>The following code demonstrates placing a map on a page: <a href="mapView.html" target="_blank">View Page</a></p>

	  <iframe src="mapView.txt"></iframe><br>  

	  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

	  <h3>HTML5</h3>
	  <p>The first entry in the page should be the specifier DOCTYPE HTML so browsers operate in
	  standards mode. In this mode, the size should be set for the html and body elements, otherwise it
	  will be assumed to be 0. For a more detailed writeup on this information, see the Google Maps API
	  tutorial.</p>

	  <h3>Viewport</h3>
	  <p>For use on the iPhone, Android and other mobile phones, the viewport meta entry should be added. This
	  will configure the browser to a fixed size so the touch events are passed on to scroll the map rather
	  than resize the browser viewport.</p>

	  <h3>Micello API</h3>
	  <p>Include the file micellomap.js to use the API. Also, you must have a Micello Map API key which is
	  registered to the domain.</p>

	  <h3>Javascript Code</h3>
	  <p>The first step to use the API is to call the function micello.maps.init(key,startupCallback) to set the
	  API key and to set a callback function. The callback function will be called when the scripts have been loaded,
	  and should be used by the developer to instantiate the map control.</p>

	  <p>The map is displayed by instantiating a micello.maps.MapControl object. To do this, you must
	  pass the HTML DOM ID of the element in which the map should be displayed. It is recommended that
	  you use a DIV element, as demonstrated above. Once the map control is instantiated, you can open
	  a community using a Micello community ID.</p>

	  <h2>The Micello Map</h2>
	  <p>The Micelloe Map is vector based map rendered on the client using the HTML5 canvas element.
	  It is suitable for use in a compatible desktop browser and mobile phone. It supports multiple levels
	  for a map and multiple maps for a single community. Objects support inline labels and mouse/touch
	  interaction.</p>
	  <p>The default behavior of the map includes a popup menu when relevant objects are clicked. From the
	  menu you can retrieve information on the object, request a route to or from that object and more.
	  (<em>NOTE: Currently not all data requests are implemented.</em>)</p>
	  <p>Using the Micello Map API, you can add interactive objects to the map and override the maps
	  default behavior.</p>
